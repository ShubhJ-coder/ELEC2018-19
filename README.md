# SUBC
All SUBC code for Elec Steering
<p>
Welcome all new SUBC members! This is the shiny, brand new SUBC git. If you haven't used GitHub before, I'll give you a quick rundown of what it's used for and some of the basics:

   <p>Git is what's known as version control. When people are writing code, they often go through many iterations before they reach the final design. 
   Version control allows you to keep all of your previous iterations, so if you make a change that messes something up, you can go back to a previous iteration without doing a bunch of CTRL+z.
   Git is AWESOME if you're working on a team because it allows everyone working on a project to have the same code, with the same changes, at their disposal.
   The most recent version of the code you have will be available to you on your computer (if you so choose), or on the GitHub repository online.</p>
</p>
<p><h1>Question: What's a repository?</h1>
	<p>A repository is where Git stores all of your previous work! You can access it online, from the link I gave you. PLEASE don't give random people the link!! We want to keep our work to ourselves :) if you'd like
	to share the repository link (ie. for an interview or something), let me know :)</p></p>

<p><h1>Another question: How do I use it?</h1>
	<p>You can either set it up on your computer or just choose to use it online. 
	If you're reading this, that means you're already got the link to the online repository. From there, you'll be able to view, download, change, and re-upload files.
	GitHub will keep track of who made the changes and what changes you made. Stuff you added will be highlighted in green, and stuff you took out will be red.</p>
	
<p><h1>Here's some terminology:</h1>
<ul>
<li> clone = a copy of the repository and all of it's current files, stored on your own computer </li>
<li> commit = a change to a file. Every time you make a change, GitHub gives it a little ID that keeps track of who made the changes and what they were.
	<p> <b>NOTE:</b> when you commit something, it's customary to leave a brief message saying what the changes you made are. <b>PLEASE DO THIS SO WE CAN KEEP TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING!!</b> 
		 Things get very confusing otherwise </p> </li>
<li> pull = this is basically updating the files stored on your computer. Make sure to commit your files before pulling, otherwise all of the changes you've made will be overwritten! </li>
<li> push = this sends all of your changes on your computer to the repository, so that everybody else can see them. Again, please make sure to do this!
	We want to make sure everyone is one the same page. </li></ul></p>

<p><h1>How to set up GitHub:</h1>

So you've got the repo (repository) link. You (kind of) know how Git and GitHub work (if you have any questions, come ask me! I'm still learning too so we can learn together).
How do you set it up on your laptop so that you can work on code from the comfort of your home?
<p>There's a lot of different ways to run GitHub. A lot of people run it from the command line, but that's kind of intimidating. I suggest you install GitHub Desktop so you don't have
to memorize a bunch of weird commands. Here's the link: https://desktop.github.com/</p>
<p>Once you've got this installed, you'll need to log in with your GitHub account. You probably had to make one to view the online repository.
</p><p>After you've logged in, here's how you get the repo on your laptop: 
<ul> <li>go to File -> Clone Repository. </li>
	<li>Then, go to the URL option at the top.</li>
<li>You'll need to create a new folder that you want to store all of this stuff in, which will go in the Local Path box. </li>
	<li>Next, copy and paste the URL from the online repository into the URL box.</li>
<li>Click clone, and there you go! Now, you'll be able to access all of the repo files from your laptop. I'll go over more on how to push, pull, and commit on Saturday!</li></ul>
